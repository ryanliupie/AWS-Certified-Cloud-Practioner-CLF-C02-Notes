## Resources Used 
The resources I used were <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NhDYbskXRgc">Andrew Brown's Course</a> on YouTube for free, paired with <a href ="https://tutorialsdojo.com/courses/aws-certified-cloud-practitioner-practice-exams/">Tutorial Dojo's practice exams</a>. When taking the practice exams, make sure you understand why your answer is right or wrong; this is extremely important to help you understand certain concepts during the real exam.  

Also, make sure to get good sleep the night before, and do not stress the day of.
